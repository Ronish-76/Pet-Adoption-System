# üîç How to Find Your MySQL Password

Since MySQL is running on your system but we can't connect with common passwords, here's how to find your MySQL root password:

## üîß Method 1: Check XAMPP (Most Common)

If you have XAMPP installed:

1. **Open XAMPP Control Panel**

   - Look for XAMPP in your Start Menu
   - Or search for "xampp" on your computer

2. **Check MySQL Configuration**

   - In XAMPP Control Panel, click "Config" next to MySQL
   - Select "my.ini" or "my.cnf"
   - Look for password settings

3. **Default XAMPP MySQL Password**
   - Usually: **no password** (empty)
   - Sometimes: `root` or `xampp`

## üîß Method 2: Check WAMP

If you have WAMP installed:

1. **Open WAMP**
2. **Right-click WAMP icon** in system tray
3. **MySQL** ‚Üí **MySQL Console**
4. **Try connecting** with different passwords

## üîß Method 3: Command Line Test

Try these commands in Command Prompt:

```bash
# Try with no password
mysql -u root

# Try with common passwords
mysql -u root -p
# Then enter: root, password, admin, etc.

# Try with different hosts
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1
mysql -u root -h localhost
```

## üîß Method 4: Reset MySQL Password

If you can't find the password, you can reset it:

### For XAMPP:

1. **Stop MySQL** in XAMPP Control Panel
2. **Delete the data folder** (backup first!)
3. **Start MySQL** - it will recreate with no password

### For Standalone MySQL:

1. **Stop MySQL service**
2. **Start MySQL in safe mode**
3. **Reset password**

## üîß Method 5: Check Installation Notes

Look for:

- Installation notes from when you installed MySQL
- Email confirmations
- Documentation files
- Configuration files in MySQL installation directory

## üéØ Quick Test

Try this in Command Prompt:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

When prompted for password, try:

- Press Enter (no password)
- `root`
- `password`
- `admin`
- `123456`

## üìù Once You Find the Password

1. **Edit the .env file** in your project root
2. **Set the correct password**:
   ```env
   DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
   ```
3. **Run the setup**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   python create_sample_data.py
   python manage.py runserver 8000
   ```

## üÜò Still Can't Find It?

If you can't find the password, we can:

1. **Reset MySQL password** (will lose existing data)
2. **Use SQLite temporarily** (for development)
3. **Install fresh MySQL** with known password

Let me know which option you prefer!
